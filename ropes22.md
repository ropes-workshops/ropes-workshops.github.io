# 1st International Workshop on Recruiting Participants for Empirical Software Engineering (RoPES'22)  

- Co-located with [ICSE 2022](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2022) 
- Virtual
- May 17, 2022


## Theme & Goals

Software studies, and the field of software engineering research, benefit from the use of high numbers of quality participants. However, participant recruitment is challenging. Recruiting people from open source projects often involves ethical hurdles like privacy protection [^Gold2020], or participant [fatigue from being over-researched](https://speakerdeck.com/gousiosg/the-number-issue32-incident). Using students can be helpful, but also suffers from generalizability to the wider software developer population [^Feldt]. On top of this, challenges due to pandemic-related health measures have made in-person studies even more difficult to conduct. Finally, the maturity of our community in understanding sampling issues [^Baltes], and the associated power calculations, effect size measurements etc. derived from samples can always be improved [^Neto].

There are also new, potentially useful tools for crowd-sourcing research, such as Mechanical Turk, or Prolific, but these tools are typically not used very often, and when they are, require careful study organization to prevent bias and flawed sampling [^Danilova]. Other communities, such as HCI and psychology, do have extensive knowledge of how to use these tools, but may not have similar expertise requirements of their subjects.

## Topics of Interest

ROPES 2022 seeks contributions addressing, but not limited to, the following
topics related to recruitment of participants in empirical software engineering:

*  strategies for new platforms like [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co), such as payment and filtering; 
*  students vs practitioners; 
*  determining adequate sample sizes; 
*  ethical considerations of participant involvement (such as GDPR, use of emails); 
*  equity, diversity and inclusion considerations, such as oversampling women; 
*  incentive structures; 
*  building reputation with a community (so they don't reject study invites); 
*  challenges with joint studies with industry and academia;
*  self-selection bias (the same people always respond); 
*  privacy and IRB restrictions; 
*  overfishing problem (returning to the same well); 
*  personal contacts effective but limited; 
*  study fadeout effect and how to get people to complete the study; 
*  use of attention questions; 
*  challenges related to recruiting the ``right" participants - right number, right background, right demographics, etc.
*  budgeting for recruitment costs.

## Keynotes

## Call for Papers 
People are invited to submit short, 2 page papers that encompass the following categories and pertain to the workshop themes:
* short position papers describing issues related to participant recruitment;
* summaries of previously published work that involved significant participant recruitment challenges, i.e. an experience report;
* extended abstracts of ongoing work or challenges.

In all cases, papers should be no more than 2 pages. All workshop papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format through the [EasyChair workshop website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ropes22). Accepted papers will then be hosted on the workshop home page. All papers will be reviewed by the PC for suitability to the topics, but we hope to accept all on-topic submissions. 

The workshop outcome will be an extended paper summarizing the workshop for a venue such as Software Engineering Notes or IEEE Software.

### Format
Please follow the [ICSE formatting guidelines](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2022/icse-2022-papers#Call-for-Papers) but anonymization is not required.
